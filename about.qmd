# About

Sophia Lecuona Manos is passionate about fisheries management and science communication. She graduated from the University of California, Santa Barbara with a B.S. in Aquatic Biology in 2022. In the Kuris Parasitology Lab, she co-led a team of undergraduates to conduct research on a newly introduced copepod that consumes the eggs of rock crabs. Her team was awarded a grant from the UCSB Coastal Fund, and she allocated funds to crab husbandry, conference registrations, and publication costs.

Sophia was honored with the "Best Student Presentation Award" at the 2022 International Conference on Copepoda (ICOC) and the 2023 Southern California Academy of Sciences (SCAS) meeting, strengthening her enthusiasm for effectively communicating scientific discoveries to both fellow scientists and the broader public. Her team was also invited to present at the 2023 Ecological Society of America (ESA) meeting.

As Sophia researched the rock crab fishery further, she was alarmed to find it was limited in data and needed improved management protocols. Sophia pursued the Bren School to deepen her understanding of resource management and the interdisciplinary aspects of sustainability within aquatic ecosystems. She is specializing in Coastal Resource Management with a focus on Strategic Environmental Communication and Media.

Her goal is to develop best practices for fisheries management and contribute to a more equitable food system by making scientific findings more accessible and impactful. She plans to achieve this by pursuing machine learning, geospatial analysis, and reproducible coding methods to identify and share solutions addressing natural resource challenges.

Sophia is currently a Master of Environmental Science and Management (MESM) candidate at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UCSB, where she worked on her Master's Project with Santa Barbara Channelkeeper. This project explored the impacts of inland sediment deposition on local beaches and the communities that use them, as well as the increased permit usage for emergency sediment disposal activities. Her second project with them focuses on watershed education and aims to create a video that will be used in classrooms throughout Santa Barbara County to teach students about their local watersheds and the importance of protecting them.

    "text": "This project involved creating a video for Santa Barbara Channelkeeper to educate local elementary and middle school students about watersheds and their importance. The video is designed to be engaging and informative, highlighting the definitions of a watershed, how humans interact with it, and why we should keep it clean.\nView Video Here\n\nThe Making of ‚ÄúWatersheds: From Mountains to Ocean‚Äù\nAn Educational Film Project\n\nProject Overview\n‚ÄúWatersheds: From Mountains to Ocean‚Äù was created as part of a collaborative effort with Santa Barbara Channelkeeper, a local environmental organization dedicated to protecting local waterways. The project aimed to translate their existing in-person watershed education program into an engaging video format for elementary and middle school students throughout Santa Barbara.\n\n\nThe Challenge\nSanta Barbara Channelkeeper had been successfully conducting hands-on watershed education in local schools, but they needed a way to reach more students and provide consistent educational content. The challenge was to capture the interactive, engaging nature of their live presentations in a video format that would resonate with young learners.\n\n\nEducational Goals\nThe film was designed to help students understand six key concepts:\n\nWhat is a watershed?\n\nThe basic definition and structure of watershed systems\n\nHuman interaction\n\nHow communities live within and impact watersheds\n\nWater sources\n\nWhere our drinking water originates and travels\n\nPollution awareness\n\nIdentifying different types of watershed pollution\n\nWater treatment\n\nUnderstanding how water is cleaned and processed\n\nEcosystem inhabitants\n\nLearning about the wildlife that depends on healthy watersheds\n\n\n\n\nProduction Process\nIt all starts with some storyboards‚Ä¶\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‚Ä¶ and a script!\n\nAnimation and Visual Effects\nOne of the most exciting aspects of the production was incorporating both my own personal animation created using Procreate on my iPad and one AI-generated animation through RunwayML. This technology allowed us to:\n\nCreate a realistic dynamic steelhead trout that brought the endangered species in our local watershed to life\nDevelop engaging visual elements that would capture students‚Äô attention while maintaining educational accuracy, teaching them the word ‚Äúspawn‚Äù by instead calling it ‚Äúfish babies‚Äù in the animation!\n\n\n\nFilming and Footage\nThe project combined footage I took on a GoPro HERO 12 with material from Eric Foote (drone footage), SBCK (underwater videos), and Adobe Stock (boy drinking water, Santa Barbara city view, etc) to create a comprehensive visual narrative.\nThe filming process involved capturing local Santa Barbara watershed environments to give students a real connection to their own community‚Äôs water systems.\n\n\n\nAudio Design and Music\nMusic selection proved to be one of the more challenging aspects of the production. Finding the right balance between engaging young audiences and maintaining an educational tone required extensive research and testing. The final audio design needed to support the learning objectives while keeping students interested throughout the presentation. Thankfully, I found a licensed Adobe Stock music track that fit the bill perfectly, providing an upbeat yet educational background that complemented the visuals.\nI also recorded a voice over of myself reading the script develped with Laura and Penny from SBCK, which was carefully crafted to be clear and engaging for young audiences. This was recorded using LogicPro.\n\n\nPost-Production\nThe editing process involved weaving together multiple elements - live footage, animations, graphics, and audio - into a cohesive educational experience. Special attention was paid to pacing and visual transitions to maintain student engagement while allowing time for concept absorption.\n\n\nCollaborative Effort\nThis project was brought to life through the combined efforts of:\n\nLaura Sanchez, Project coordination and production support\nPenny Owens, Educational content development and community outreach\nAlexandra Phillips, Technical and resource support\nEric Foote, Drone footage and cinematography\nGuillermo and Tera Lecuona, Animation and voice over assistance\n\n\n\nImpact and Distribution\nThe completed film serves as a valuable educational resource that can be used in classrooms throughout Santa Barbara County and beyond. By creating this video, Santa Barbara Channelkeeper can now reach students who might not otherwise have access to their watershed education program, extending their environmental education mission to a broader audience.\n\n\nReflection\nCreating educational content for young audiences requires a delicate balance of entertainment and information. This project succeeded in translating complex environmental concepts into accessible, engaging content that empowers students to understand their role in protecting local watersheds. The collaboration between filmmakers and environmental educators resulted in a resource that will continue to educate and inspire future generations of environmental stewards. I look forward to seeing how this video will be used in classrooms and the impact it will have on students‚Äô understanding of their local watersheds!"

Orli, Sophia M. Lecuona, Gabrielle O. Plewe, Carson N. Gadler, Armand M. Kuris, Zoe L. Zilz, Danny Tang\nWe report the first detection of a nicothoid copepod in the genus Choniosphaera infesting the egg masses of three commercially important rock crab species (Metacarcinus anthonyi, Romaleon antennarium, and Cancer productus) along the Santa Barbara coast. This previously undocumented egg predator was discovered during routine laboratory work and subsequently found to be widespread in local crab populations. Our observations suggest that Choniosphaera sp. may significantly impact crab fecundity, posing a potential threat to the region‚Äôs rock crab fishery. This study highlights the importance of continued monitoring for emerging parasitic threats in marine ecosystems and calls for further research into the ecological impact and distribution of this copepod.\nIn review at Ecology (Scientific Naturalist)"

The vulnerable apex predator Carcharodon carcharias, colloquially referred to as white sharks, is an important species in Seal Island, False Bay, South Africa. Because it is so easily impacted by human interference, information on the species is very necessary to produce efficient methods of conservation. A large threat, fishing in Seal Island needs more information on how to avoid encounters with white sharks that can be detrimental to their health, such as accidentally being caught by fisheries. This report used number of sharks as a response variable, y, in statistical analyses with exploratory variables time of day (AM/PM), water temperature (¬∞C), water visibility (good, moderate, poor), and sea state (calm, choppy, rough). The only exploratory variable that had a significant impact on the number of sharks was water visibility, in which poor water visibility significantly reduced the number of white sharks present.\nView Report Here"

    "text": "Sophia Lecuona Manos is passionate about fisheries management and science communication. She graduated from the University of California, Santa Barbara with a B.S. in Aquatic Biology in 2022. In the Kuris Parasitology Lab, she co-led a team of undergraduates to conduct research on a newly introduced copepod that consumes the eggs of rock crabs. Her team was awarded a grant from the UCSB Coastal Fund, and she allocated funds to crab husbandry, conference registrations, and publication costs.\nSophia was honored with the ‚ÄúBest Student Presentation Award‚Äù at the 2022 International Conference on Copepoda (ICOC) and the 2023 Southern California Academy of Sciences (SCAS) meeting, strengthening her enthusiasm for effectively communicating scientific discoveries to both fellow scientists and the broader public. Her team was also invited to present at the 2023 Ecological Society of America (ESA) meeting.\nAs Sophia researched the rock crab fishery further, she was alarmed to find it was limited in data and needed improved management protocols. Sophia pursued the Bren School to deepen her understanding of resource management and the interdisciplinary aspects of sustainability within aquatic ecosystems. She is specializing in Coastal Resource Management with a focus on Strategic Environmental Communication and Media.\nHer goal is to develop best practices for fisheries management and contribute to a more equitable food system by making scientific findings more accessible and impactful. She plans to achieve this by pursuing machine learning, geospatial analysis, and reproducible coding methods to identify and share solutions addressing natural resource challenges.\nSophia is currently a Master of Environmental Science and Management (MESM) candidate at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UCSB, where she worked on her Master‚Äôs Project with Santa Barbara Channelkeeper. This project explored the impacts of inland sediment deposition on local beaches and the communities that use them, as well as the increased permit usage for emergency sediment disposal activities. Her second project with them focuses on watershed education and aims to create a video that will be used in classrooms throughout Santa Barbara County to teach students about their local watersheds and the importance of protecting them.\n\n\n\nOutstanding Teaching Assistant (TA) Nomination\n2023-24 Academic Senate Outstanding Teaching Assistant Award, UCSB\nNominated due to student and professor reviews.\n\nBest Student Presentation Award\n2023 Southern California Academy of Sciences Annual Meeting\nMay 2023, Southern California Society of Parasitologists (SCSP)\nPresented compelling research with colleagues Jaden Orli and Gabrielle Plewe on a novel copepod egg predator infesting commercially important rock crabs in Santa Barbara, CA, through an oral presentation.
